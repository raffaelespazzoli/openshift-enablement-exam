  syncPolicy:
    automated: # automated sync by default retries failed attempts 5 times with following delays between attempts ( 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s ); retry controlled using `retry` field.
      prune: true # Specifies if resources should be pruned during auto-syncing ( false by default ).
      selfHeal: true # Specifies if partial app sync should be executed when resources are changed only in target Kubernetes cluster and no git change detected ( false by default ).
      allowEmpty: false # Allows deleting all application resources during automatic syncing ( false by default ).
    syncOptions:     # Sync options which modifies sync behavior
    - Validate=false # disables resource validation (equivalent to 'kubectl apply --validate=false') ( true by default ).
    - CreateNamespace=true # Namespace Auto-Creation ensures that namespace specified as the application destination exists in the destination cluster.
    - PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground # Supported policies are background, foreground and orphan.
    - PruneLast=true # Allow the ability for resource pruning to happen as a final, implicit wave of a sync operation
    - RespectIgnoreDifferences=true # When syncing changes, respect fields ignored by the ignoreDifferences configuration

    # The retry feature is available since v1.7
    retry:
      limit: -1 # number of failed sync attempt retries; unlimited number of attempts if less than 0
      backoff:
        duration: 5s # the amount to back off. Default unit is seconds, but could also be a duration (e.g. "2m", "1h")
        factor: 2 # a factor to multiply the base duration after each failed retry
        maxDuration: 3m # the maximum amount of time allowed for the backoff strategy
